# DiscordBot - Experimenting with python and APIs

This is a tiny discord bot built with python. It executes basic commands. Its main purpose is to practice APIs and python.

**Info:** The API keys have been put in a .env file but that file is in .gitignore as they otherwise could be used by other people.
